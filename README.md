# Marvel Pocket Companion
An Android App powered Marvel's Public Developer API

This started off as a school project for an Android development course. I really enjoyed working on it and wanted to make it public.
If you have any suggestions or improvements, I'd love to hear them, especially as I'm new to app development.

## Instructions
### Sign up for an API Account
* Sign up for an account at https://developer.marvel.com/
* Visit your account page to get your public and private keys
  * https://developer.marvel.com/account  
### Update the code with your keys
* Replace the placeholders in `ApiConfig.java`
* If you have a better way to do this, please submit a pull request
### Run the app
* Fire up an Android Virtual Device (AVD) or use your own via USB.
### Other Notes
* There's a hardcoded help email address and phone number in `AboutActivity.java`. Might want to update those.
